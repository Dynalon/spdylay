The htdocs folder have to be specially crafted:

* Only subfolder from htdocs are served
* Command used for creating sample pages:

	wget --page-requisites --convert-links --no-host-directories --cut-dirs=20 --directory-prefix=. $URI

* All .html files within a subfolder MAY have a corresponding .html.map file
* The .map file list the associated content for that particular .html file
* No leading ./ or / are allowed in the .html.map file

* Map files can be easily created with this command:

* A file content.map MUST exist within each subfolder that enumerates 
  EVERY non-html file in the subfolder

  example content.map:
  
  00001 image1.jpg
  00002 image2.jpg

  etc.

* A content.map can be easily created with:

	find ./* -printf "%f\n" -type f | grep -v ".htm" | nl -s" " -n rz
