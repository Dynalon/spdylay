The htdocs folder have to be specially crafted:

* Only subfolder from htdocs are served
* Every subfolder MUST have a index.html
* All other files in a subfolder are associated content
* A file assoc.txt MUST exist that holds relative paths for
  each file that is to be delivered as associated content
  I.e:
  ./script.js
  ./moon.jpg

  etc.
