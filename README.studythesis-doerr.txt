This is a modified version of the SPDYLAY SPDY client/server implementation.

The htdocs/ folder contains all sample website data used in the thesis. The src/bench.sh script contains a benchmark script that invokes client/server and performs test runs. This script is specific to a computer lab science at the KIT and must be adjusted accordingly when used in a different lab.
